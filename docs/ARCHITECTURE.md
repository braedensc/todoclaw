## ADR-0001 — Frontend toolchain: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript (strict) + Tailwind 3

**Date:** 2026-06-23 · **Stage:** 1 (PR #1)

The walking-skeleton toolchain. Resolved versions: Vite 8, `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6,
React 18.3, TypeScript 6, Tailwind 3.4, TanStack Query 5, `@supabase/supabase-js` 2, Zod 4.

- **React pinned to 18, not 19.** The master plan specifies React 18; staying on it avoids
  churn from React 19's breaking changes until the feature set is stable. Revisit post-parity.
- **Tailwind pinned to v3, not v4.** v4's CSS-first config (`@import "tailwindcss"`,
  `@tailwindcss/postcss`) is a different setup from the v3 `tailwind.config.js` +
  `@tailwind` directives + `autoprefixer` model the plan describes. v3 is the well-trodden,
  lower-friction path for now; a v4 migration is a deliberate later task, not an accident of
  `npm install` resolving `latest`.
- **Hand-written config over `npm create vite`.** The scaffolder would clobber the Stage 0
  `package.json` (husky/secretlint) and pull in an ESLint config we're deferring to Stage 2.
  Writing the handful of config files keeps full control and matches the "explicit over
  clever" convention.
- **Rejected:** Next.js (we want a pure SPA on Vite + Supabase, no SSR/server framework);
  CRA (unmaintained).

## ADR-0002 — TypeScript project-reference layout (solution + app + node)

**Date:** 2026-06-23 · **Stage:** 1 (PR #1)

`tsconfig.json` is a solution file (`files: []`, references) pointing at `tsconfig.app.json`
(browser/`src`, `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `noUnusedLocals/Parameters`) and
`tsconfig.node.json` (`vite.config.ts`, `types: ["node"]`). `npm run build` runs
`tsc -b && vite build`; `npm run typecheck` runs `tsc -b`.

- The two environments have genuinely different globals (DOM vs. Node). Splitting them is the
  canonical Vite layout and keeps the app config free of Node types.
- `@types/node` is required by `tsconfig.node.json` because Vite's own `.d.ts` references
  `Buffer`/`Request`/`WebSocket`. Without it, `tsc -b` fails — installed as a devDependency.

## ADR-0003 — Env-var strategy: anon key client-side, service-role server-only

**Date:** 2026-06-23 · **Stage:** 1 (PR #1)

Only `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` reach the frontend (typed in
`src/vite-env.d.ts`). The anon key is public by design — **Row Level Security is the real
access guard**. The service-role key bypasses RLS and never appears in any frontend file,
`.env.example`, or the bundle; it is not used by app code in Stage 1 at all.

- `.env.example` (placeholders) is the only committed env file. `.env.local` (real local
  values) is gitignored.
- **Claude cannot create `.env.local`** — the `PreToolUse` hook blocks writes to `.env*`
  files and JWT-shaped values (the local anon key is a JWT). That's the security model working
  as intended; creating `.env.local` is a human/shell step (see SETUP.md).

## ADR-0004 — Drag/drop spike deferred to Stage 3 (not Stage 1)

**Date:** 2026-06-23 · **Stage:** 1 (PR #1)

The master plan calls for spiking @dnd-kit vs. raw pointer events for the free-canvas grid.
That belongs with grid work in **Stage 3**, not the Stage 1 skeleton — Stage 1 only proves the
pipeline (toolchain → DB → auth → render), so no drag/drop dependency is added yet.
