# ADR-0006 — Production topology + encrypted backups

**Date:** 2026-06-23 · **Stage:** 1 (PR #3)

- **One cloud Supabase project = prod; local Docker = dev.** No staging project (keeps cost at
  zero); the local stack is the safe place to break things. The Claude Code hook blocks
  destructive ops against remote DBs, so the single prod project is protected from a
  fat-fingered reset.
- **Security headers/CSP** ship via `vercel.json` (HSTS, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, nosniff,
  CSP limiting `connect-src` to self + `*.supabase.co`). Auth hardening lives in the Supabase
  dashboard (human-only toggles), documented in SERVICES.md.
- **Backups: daily encrypted `pg_dump` of the `public` schema → GitHub Actions artifact**
  (90-day retention). Authenticated by a dedicated least-privilege **`backup_ro`** role
  (SELECT on `public` only — not service-role). GitHub artifacts were chosen over R2/B2 for
  zero extra setup to prove the pipeline; the upload step is the only thing to swap if we later
  want longer retention / off-platform durability. The dump → encrypt → decrypt → restore
  round-trip is proven locally before ship.
- **One-time `db push`** seeds the cloud schema (a documented bootstrap exception); CI-driven
  migrations on merge are a Stage 2/6 task.

**Update (2026-06-23) — backup auth reality.** The least-privilege `backup_ro` plan didn't
survive contact with Supabase's managed pooler: the **free pooler (Supavisor) only accepts the
built-in `postgres` user**, not custom roles, and the **direct connection is IPv6-only** (GitHub
Actions runners are IPv4-only → "Network unreachable"). So the daily backup authenticates as
`postgres` via the **session pooler** (`aws-1-us-west-2…`, port 5432, `sslmode=require`), with
the dump still scoped to `--schema=public`. Tradeoff accepted: the backup secret holds the main
DB credential (rotate if exposed). `backup_ro` is created and reserved for restoring strict
least-privilege once we add the Supabase **IPv4 add-on** or a **self-hosted runner**. Backup →
encrypt → upload verified working in prod (encrypted artifact produced).
