"""Tier 0 — local dispatch. Bind ONE local session to ONE ticket, by hand.

**THIS IS A HUMAN TOOL. AN AGENT MUST NEVER RUN IT FOR ITSELF.**

The pin is the pipeline's one piece of authority a session cannot write
(docs/PIPELINE-CONTRACT.md §3): the dispatcher places it outside every worktree
*before* the session starts, and every guard that matters reads it. A session
that could place its own pin could retarget itself at another ticket, widen its
own scope fence, or hand itself a budget nobody granted — which is the exact
attack the pin architecture exists to prevent. So this script refuses to run
when it detects a Claude Code / agent environment (see `AGENT_ENV_MARKERS`).

That refusal is **tamper-evident, not tamper-proof** — the same posture §3 takes
about `chmod 0444` — because a session's shell runs as the same user and can
scrub an environment variable. The real enforcement, if the project wants one,
belongs in the PreToolUse hook, which is self-protected and which this script
deliberately does not touch.

WHY THIS EXISTS

    Before this, the ONLY thing that wrote a pin was the GitHub Actions
    dispatcher (`templates/workflows/pipeline-dispatch.yml`). In a project that
    had just gained a `delivery.json`, `/work` therefore could not run at all:
    it resolved `pinsRoot`, computed the pin key, found no pin, and failed
    closed — correctly, per §2 (configured + `session_mode: ticket` + missing
    pin = BROKEN). The guard was right; the gap was that a human had no way to
    write the binding it wanted. That inverted the intended order, where a local
    loop proves the ticket → session → PR path cheaply before the whole
    credential and dispatch surface is stood up.

    This script is that missing half, and nothing more. It writes the same pin,
    at the same key, into the same store, with the same write protocol as §3's
    dispatcher steps 2–3. It never starts a session, never touches the tracker's
    state or labels, never creates a branch, and never merges anything.

WHAT IT IS NOT

    Not a dispatcher backend. `dispatch.backend` still names where unattended
    sessions run; a local dispatch is outside that accounting entirely. In
    particular there is NO dispatcher state record (§9) here, so a local
    dispatch consumes no `totalAttempts` slot and no `dailyUsd` reservation, and
    the `budget` block it pins is advisory: nothing meters a human's own
    session. `--attempt` exists so a re-run can say so honestly rather than
    reporting "attempt 1" three times.

READS

    `pinsRoot` and every other value come from the COMMITTED `delivery.json` on
    the default branch, resolved through the same ref list and the same
    fallback as `.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.py::_read_delivery_config`. Matching
    the reader matters more than being stricter than it: if this script and the
    hook disagreed about which config to believe, they would disagree about
    where the pin lives, and every pin would read as absent.

KEY DERIVATION

    pin_key = sha256(realpath(<session root>))[:16]

    One derivation, three renderings — here, the hook's `_pin_path`, and the
    dispatch workflow's `printf '%s' "$root" | sha256sum | cut -c1-16`.
    `--selftest` asserts all three still agree.

USAGE

    pipeline_dispatch_local.py <TICKET-ID> [options]     # write the pin
    pipeline_dispatch_local.py --release [options]       # remove it (teardown)
    pipeline_dispatch_local.py --show [options]          # what is bound here?
    pipeline_dispatch_local.py --selftest

    Ticket source: the Linear API by default (the key is read from the
    environment variable named by --api-key-env, never passed as a flag), or
    --ticket-file for an offline dispatch. Both go through the Definition-of
    -Ready gate's parser — one description, one parser (§3).

EXIT

    0 = pin written / released / shown
    1 = refused (empty acceptance criteria, a pin already here, a bad config,
        an agent environment) — nothing was written
    2 = usage, I/O, or "the pipeline is not configured for this project"

    §2's silence rule ("absent is off — exit 0, emit nothing") governs guards,
    skills and workflows that run IMPLICITLY; it exists so an un-opted-in
    project is never bricked. This script blocks nothing and is invoked
    explicitly, so exiting 0 without writing the pin its caller asked for would
    just be a lie. It says so and exits 2 instead.
