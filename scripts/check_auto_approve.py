"""Provenance-gated auto-approval — `raw` → `ready` without a human, or not.

Deterministic, model-free, stdlib only. This is the *decision* half of the
approval boundary; `.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.py`'s `self-approval` guard is the
*denial* half. The guard refuses every attempt a session makes to move its own
ticket into `ready`; this script decides which tickets may legitimately be moved
there by an out-of-session automation that holds the tracker credential.

    guard  → "no session may approve anything"            (always, unconditional)
    this   → "these tickets qualify without a human"      (narrow, recomputed)

THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE WHOLE POINT (contract §5). A ticket auto-approves only
when its provenance is `epic/<ID>` — decomposed from an epic a human already
approved. `monitor`, `review`, `retro-proposal` and `human` never auto-approve,
and the reason is adversarial, not stylistic: those are exactly the paths an
attacker-influenced payload takes into the backlog. A monitor files what a
failing probe told it; a review pass files what it read in a diff; a retro
proposes what it inferred from its own telemetry. If any of those could approve
itself, the pipeline could widen its own mandate by writing a ticket — and
"write a ticket that asks for X" is a capability every one of those paths has.
`epic/*` is the only class whose approval is anchored in something a human did.

Every gate below must pass. They are checked in a fixed order and ALL are
evaluated (no short-circuit), so one run reports every reason a ticket is held
rather than making an operator fix them one at a time.

  config        delivery.json present, version recognized
  enabled       autonomy.autoApproveProvenance non-empty and ⊆ ["epic"] (§5 r3)
  state         the ticket is actually sitting in linear.stateIds.raw
  supervision   no dispatcher-owned agent:*/blocked:* label, no hooks-change (§6)
  provenance    resolves to epic/<ID> per §5 rule 4 (label class + parent link)
  epic          that epic exists and a human moved it out of intake (§5 rule 2)
  dor           scripts/check_ticket_dor.py passes, in --strict mode
  risk-paths    nothing the ticket names matches autonomy.riskPaths (§1)

FAIL DIRECTION. Contract §3's read protocol: "checks that would GRANT extra
autonomy fail closed". Approval is the largest grant in the pipeline, so every
uncertainty here — absent config, unparseable config, an epic the caller could
not fetch, a state ID that matches nothing — HOLDS. That is the opposite of
`scripts/check_delivery_config.py`, which must emit nothing at all when
`delivery.json` is absent (§2: absent is *off*, not broken). The difference is
that a validator absent-cases into "there is nothing to validate", while an
approval gate absent-cases into "approve everything", and only one of those is
safe to be silent about.

WHY THE EPIC IS PASSED IN, NOT FETCHED. This script holds no credential and
makes no network call, so it stays runnable in CI, in a selftest, and on a
laptop against a pasted ticket. The caller that *does* hold the tracker key
fetches the epic and hands it over with `--epic`. A missing epic is a HOLD, so
the offline posture cannot be used to skip §5 rule 2: not fetching it is
indistinguishable, to this script, from it not existing.

Usage:
    check_auto_approve.py [--config PATH] [--repo-root DIR] [--epic FILE]
                          [--json] [--no-dor-strict] [FILE ...]
    check_auto_approve.py --selftest

Input: one ticket object, a bare list, or {"tickets": [...]} — file(s) or stdin,
the same shapes `check_ticket_dor.py` accepts, because it is the same ticket.
`--epic` takes an epic ticket object, a list, or {"epics": {...}} keyed by ID.

Exit: 0 = every ticket approved, 1 = at least one held, 2 = usage/IO/config error.

Tokens refresh only after a 401, so every session shows one failed request.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A token within 5 minutes of expiry is refreshed before the request is sent
- [ ] `npm test` covers the near-expiry path and passes

## Out of scope

- Refresh-token rotation and reuse detection (separate ticket)

## Test plan

- `npm test` with a clock stubbed to 4 minutes before expiry

## Pointers

- `README.md` holds the current auth notes
