"""Conflict self-resolution — one loop, two halves, one marker grammar.

    pr_conflict.py monitor [--dry-run]              # GitHub Actions (pr-conflict-monitor.yml)
    pr_conflict.py wake [--repo-dir DIR]... [opts]  # a PERSON's machine, as a LaunchAgent
    pr_conflict.py --selftest

  `wake` is installed and supervised by scripts/pipeline_conflict_waker_setup.py — one
  LaunchAgent per person, a heartbeat, a signed-off dry run. Nobody types a loop. That
  installer is macOS-only; `wake` is not. It is one pass of plain Python that shells `gh`
  and `claude` and exits, so a systemd timer or cron runs it anywhere
  (docs/COLLABORATION.md, parallel-session protocol item 8).

THE GAP THIS CLOSES

  A session opens a PR, drives it green and ends its turn. The Stop hook
  (.claude/hooks/stop-pr-check.py) samples merge state at that turn-end and never
  again: it holds no timer, so when a sibling merges and main moves, the PR goes
  CONFLICTING with nobody watching. The monitor workflow saw it — and could only
  page a person, because nothing in the repo can re-invoke an idle local session.
  With many parallel sessions that person becomes the only bridge between
  "detected" and "resolved" (docs/LESSONS.md, 2026-09-15).

WHY THE FIX RUNS LOCALLY, NOT IN ACTIONS

  The template's answer is an `@claude` comment for claude.yml. It needs a model
  credential in Actions, a PAT (GITHUB_TOKEN-authored comments and pushes fire no
  workflows, so neither the handoff nor the fix's CI would start), `workflows`
  scope for any conflict under .github/workflows/, and it runs the model OUTSIDE
  the PreToolUse hooks. The sessions that own these branches already exist on a
  machine that holds the owner's credentials and runs the hooks. So GitHub keeps
  the clock and the budget; the machine does the work:

    monitor (Actions)                     wake (a person's machine)
    ─────────────────                     ─────────────────────────
    CONFLICTING, new episode
      → label + `request` marker   ──►    sees an unclaimed request for a branch
                                          one of ITS worktrees holds
                                          → `ack` marker, then `claude -p` in that
                                            worktree: merge the PR's base, resolve,
                                            push, watch CI — never merge or approve
                                          → re-reads mergeable → `result` marker
    next tick:
      MERGEABLE        → drop label (episode over)
      no ack in 15 min → ESCALATE (page a person — WHO A PAGE REACHES)
      no result in 2 h → ESCALATE
      result, still CONFLICTING → ESCALATE
      budget spent (3 requests on this PR) or a fork → page, never request

  The cost, said plainly: the loop closes only while a waker runs on a machine
  that holds the branch's worktree and is awake. When it does not, the monitor's
  deadline turns that into a page — the same page as before, never silence.

WHOSE PULL REQUEST THE WAKER MAY TAKE — AND WHOSE IT MAY NEVER TAKE

  A fix session starts OUTSIDE any sandbox, as the person running the waker, and
  reads a branch it did not write. That is fine for a branch the same person's own
  local session wrote, and wrong for one a dispatcher's SANDBOXED session wrote:
  the fix would run with the owner's reach over text a sandboxed agent authored.
  A dispatcher's PR has its own wake path that keeps the sandbox — the Stage E
  bounce driver re-prompts the original session in its tracker thread
  (scripts/pipeline_bounce_local.py, the `conflict` action), and it answers the
  same `request` marker. So the waker takes a request only when ALL of these hold,
  and each is a fact a dispatcher's session cannot write:

    * the worktree holding the branch belongs to THIS uid, and
    * THIS user's own Claude Code has worked in it — a transcript under
      `<claude config dir>/projects/<the worktree path, non-alphanumerics as '-'>`,
      owned by this uid. A dispatcher's sessions run as its role account and keep
      their transcripts under THAT home, which this uid cannot write; and
    * the waker is not itself running as a dispatcher's role account (it refuses
      where `~/.stage-e/env` exists — that account's PRs are the bounce driver's)
      or as root.

  A request none of that matches is left alone, and the monitor's ack deadline
  turns it into a page. If Claude Code ever moves its transcripts, every request
  reads "no local session" and pages — loud, never a fix in the wrong place.

WHAT A PASS IS BOUNDED BY

  Per session: `--max-budget-usd` and `--timeout-min`. Per pass: `--max-sessions`,
  and the product of the two must fit inside the monitor's result deadline (so a
  queued session is never still working when the monitor pages about it). Every
  session this pass will run is ACKNOWLEDGED BEFORE THE FIRST STARTS, so a queue
  cannot miss the ack deadline. Per PR, lifetime: the monitor's three requests.
  A request over the pass cap is not acknowledged and is said by number: the
  monitor pages it. No loop anywhere — launchd starts the next pass.

THE BASE BRANCH IS GITHUB'S, NEVER ASSUMED

  Every recipe, headline and fix prompt names the PR's own `baseRefName` — the branch
  GitHub computed `mergeable` against — and falls back to the repository's default
  branch, read once per run and cached on `Gh`. A stacked PR, or a repository whose
  default is `trunk`, gets a command that runs. The bounce driver picks its base the
  same way, so the two lanes hand a session the same command.

WHO A PAGE REACHES

  An @mention of an ORGANIZATION notifies nobody, so the page never names the
  repository owner blindly. It names, in order: the logins in `--page-to` (the
  PR_CONFLICT_PAGE_TO repository variable in the workflow); else the PR's author, when
  that is a person; else the repository owner, when that is a person. The comment says
  which. When none applies — a bot's PR on an organization's repository, with no
  --page-to — the comment says nobody was paged and the run exits 1, because a page
  that reaches nobody must not look delivered.

MARKERS (the whole producer/consumer contract)

  The FIRST LINE of a comment, exactly:

    <!-- pr-conflict:request episode=N -->                      github-actions[bot]
    <!-- pr-conflict:page episode=N reason=budget|fork -->      github-actions[bot]
    <!-- pr-conflict:escalated episode=N -->                    github-actions[bot]
    <!-- pr-conflict:ack episode=N -->                          OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR
    <!-- pr-conflict:result episode=N outcome=O -->             OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR

  Bot markers count only from the Actions bot, so the budget cannot be reset by a
  comment. Waker markers count only from a writer, and only when posted after the
  episode opened, so an ack cannot be pre-posted for a future episode. A waker
  marker can never grant anything: an ack only moves the deadline (bounded), and a
  result only ends the wait — whether the conflict is gone is read from GitHub's
  own `mergeable`, never from the claim. Session output embedded in a result
  comment is neutralized, and only the first line is ever parsed, so a session
  cannot forge a marker (docs/LESSONS.md, agent-forged markers).

WHAT NEITHER HALF EVER DOES (asserted in --selftest)

  Merge, enable auto-merge, approve, push, or write any label except `conflict`.
  The fix session runs under the repo's own hooks, which block all of those too.

EXIT CODES (contract §13)

  0  the pass completed — it printed what it asked and what the answer was
  1  could not tell: mergeability never settled, a listing was truncated, a
     GitHub call failed, or a fix session ended with GitHub unable to say whether
     the conflict is gone. Never the same token as "no conflicts". Also: a page
     was posted that notifies nobody (WHO A PAGE REACHES).
  2  usage error
  3  REFUSED — `wake` (not --dry-run) in an agent environment, as root, or as a
     dispatcher's role account

THE WAKER'S HEARTBEAT (contract §13)

  Every real `wake` pass writes `<state dir>/heartbeat.json`
  (`pr-conflict-waker-heartbeat/1`): a `running` beat first, then `started_at`,
  `finished_at`, `result` (ok | idle | problems | error) and what it did. A stale
  file is NOT RUNNING; a fresh one saying `idle` is ran-and-had-nothing-to-do.
  A dry run and a refusal write none, so neither can impersonate a pass.

PR #{number} (branch `{branch}`) now has merge conflicts with `{base}`: `{base}` moved after this PR \
went green, so its required checks are not running. You are in this branch's worktree. Resolve it:

1. Confirm `git status` is clean and you are on `{branch}`.
2. `git fetch origin {base} && git merge origin/{base}` — merge, do not rebase. A rebase ends in a \
force-push under a branch a session may still hold, and stops mid-way on a detached HEAD.
3. Resolve each conflict by reading BOTH sides and keeping both intents. Where they genuinely \
contradict, do not pick one: stop and say what contradicts.
4. Run the project's local checks (CLAUDE.md names them), commit the merge with `git commit -F`, \
and `git push` (never --force).
5. Watch CI to green: `gh pr checks {number} --watch`.

Never merge this PR, never approve it, never add or remove labels. If you cannot resolve it \
safely, push nothing and end with a short account of what conflicts and why."""
