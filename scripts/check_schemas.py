"""Keeps `schemas/` and `docs/PIPELINE-CONTRACT.md` from becoming two truths.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT

    The contract was prose that agents READ and TRIED to follow, and every
    consumer re-implemented its rules by hand. Two independent implementations
    of one truth are free to drift — and they did: `/setup-board` shipped a
    `delivery.json` emitter that shared ZERO field names with §1, which would
    have bricked the repo it was setting up (the PreToolUse hook classifies a
    version-less config as BROKEN and fails closed, blocking every tool call).

    Fixing that instance fixed one bug. This script fixes the class: the schema
    is the machine-readable rendering of the contract, and CI fails if the two
    disagree about which fields exist.

WHAT IT CHECKS

  1. Every shipped schema is expressible by scripts/jsonschema_mini.py — no
     keyword that silently does nothing (`check_schema`).
  2. `delivery.example.json` validates against `schemas/delivery.schema.json`,
     so the example can never drift from the spec again.
  3. The malformed shape `/setup-board` used to emit is REJECTED — a pinned
     regression fixture for the bug that started this.
  4. Contract ⇄ schema parity, at the granularity each section's own rendering
     supports:
       §1 — EXACT, BIDIRECTIONAL, BY PATH. §1 documents `delivery.json` as one
            `### <section>` heading per top-level key with a `| Field |` table
            under it, so a full dotted path can be reconstructed for every row
            and compared against the schema's property paths. A field in one
            and not the other fails.
       §3, §4, §8 — BIDIRECTIONAL BY NAME. These sections mix tables with JSON
            examples and prose, so a path is not always reconstructable. Every
            field NAME in the section's `Field`/`Fields` tables must appear
            somewhere in the schema, and every property name in the schema must
            be named somewhere in the section — as inline code, or as a key in
            its canonical shape example. Weaker than §1's check, and honest
            about it: it still catches "the contract grew a field and the
            schema did not", which is the drift that hurts.
  5. Each schema accepts a valid fixture and rejects targeted malformations, so
     "the schema exists" never gets confused with "the schema has teeth".

Usage:
    check_schemas.py                          # validate this repo's own instances
    check_schemas.py --instance PATH --schema NAME
    check_schemas.py --list
    check_schemas.py --selftest

Exit: 0 = everything checked conforms
      1 = a schema, an instance, or contract⇄schema parity failed
      2 = usage/IO error
