"""`delivery.json` validator — the contract §7 checklist, mechanized.

Deterministic, model-free, stdlib only. Without this, a project can adopt the
pipeline with a malformed config and only find out at dispatch time, when the
failure is expensive and remote.

TWO LAYERS, ONE DEFINITION OF SHAPE

    SHAPE comes from `schemas/delivery.schema.json` — a real JSON Schema, and
    the single machine-readable rendering of contract §1. This file no longer
    re-implements "stateIds is an object with exactly five string values" in
    Python; it validates against the schema and translates each violation into
    the rule vocabulary and tier §7 uses (via the schema's own `x-rule`,
    `x-tier` and `x-fix` annotations). `scripts/check_schemas.py` fails CI if
    §1 and the schema disagree about which fields exist, so the two cannot
    drift the way the contract and this validator once could.

    SEMANTICS stay here, because a schema structurally cannot express them:
    an ID that is RESOLVED rather than merely a string, a path that lands
    outside every worktree ON THIS DISK, `perEffort[e].maxTurns` compared
    against `budgets.maxTurns`, `statePath` against `backend`, the exact
    `riskPaths` floor, and `branch.types` against the LIVE guard's own regex.

    This is defense in depth, not a handoff. A schema-valid config can still
    carry a UUID that resolves to nothing.

THE ONE RULE THAT OUTRANKS EVERY OTHER RULE HERE (contract §2):

    delivery.json ABSENT is OFF, not broken. This validator exits 0 and emits
    NOTHING — no diagnostics, no git, no network. Off must be indistinguishable
    from a kit checkout that never heard of the pipeline. So the existence test
    runs FIRST, ahead of anything that can fail: a fail-closed guard whose
    PRECONDITION is missing takes the project hostage, and because the guard
    machinery is self-protected the agent cannot repair it (docs/LESSONS.md).

    delivery.json PRESENT but unparseable, or failing a §7 rule, is BROKEN:
    fail with a reason naming the file and the fix. Presence is a promise.

The kit itself ships `delivery.example.json` and never a live `delivery.json`,
so in THIS repo the validator is inert by design — `--selftest` is what CI runs,
and it exercises every rule against synthetic configs.

Two tiers:

  ERRORS   — the §7 MUST-fail rows, plus the structural preconditions a §7 row
             cannot be evaluated without (e.g. `budgets.maxTurns` must exist and
             be an integer before "perEffort may only lower the cap" means
             anything). §7 is a floor, not a ceiling.
  WARNINGS — everything the contract specifies but does not make a MUST-fail:
             unresolved non-required label IDs, an unknown `dispatch.backend`,
             a non-zero `autonomy.autoMergeMaxLines`, and similar. `--strict`
             promotes them. Which tier a schema violation lands in is declared
             in the schema, as `x-tier` / `x-tier-<keyword>`.

`telemetry` is defined in the schema (it is part of §1) but DELIBERATELY not
judged here. Every §7 row gates autonomy; telemetry gates nothing, and a
project with a misconfigured sink loses dashboards, not supervision. Its own
consumer validates it at the point of use.

Every message cites the contract section it comes from, because the fix almost
always lives in the prose, not in the field name.

Config source: the WORKING-TREE copy. Contract §1 sends guard-relevant reads to
the committed copy on the default branch (`git show origin/main:delivery.json`)
precisely because a session can edit its own worktree — but this validator is
not a guard and grants a session nothing. It judges the config as authored in
this tree, which is the only useful thing to judge in the PR that changes it.
Same reasoning as `scripts/check_ticket_dor.py`.

Usage:
    check_delivery_config.py [--strict] [--json] [--config PATH] [--repo-root DIR]
    check_delivery_config.py --selftest

Exit: 0 = off, or valid (warnings alone do not fail)
      1 = broken (unparseable, or a rule failed)
      2 = usage/IO error (an explicit --config that does not exist, or a kit
          checkout whose delivery schema is missing or unreadable)
