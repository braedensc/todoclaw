"""
Stop hook for Todoclaw: nudges Claude before ending a turn on a pushed branch
that either (a) has no PR yet, or (b) has an open PR with failing CI that Claude
could actually fix. CLAUDE.md says "open a PR when the task is done" and "watch
CI to green," but those written rules weren't reliably followed across parallel
worktree sessions (2026-07-03) — this makes both a hard-to-miss reminder instead.

Only fires once per (branch, HEAD commit, reason) — tracked in
.claude/.stop-pr-nag/, gitignored — so it cannot loop even if the harness
doesn't honor stop_hook_active — re-blocking on an unchanged commit/reason
would trap Claude if it explains rather than pushes a new commit. Keying by
reason (not just commit) means opening the PR after a "no PR" nag doesn't
suppress a later "CI failing" nag on that same commit.

The two not-green reasons additionally share ONE bounded budget per branch
(see MAX_FIX_ATTEMPTS): the per-commit dedup above stops a loop on an
unchanged commit, but a session that keeps pushing fixes gets a new sha each
time and was nagged forever. Some failures no session can clear — a fix under
.github/workflows/ that its push credential is deliberately not allowed to
land, a rebase the sandbox will not let it perform — and telling it to try
again is then pure waste. After the budget the hook escalates once, loudly,
and stops blocking.

# apply `hooks-change` at all (TOD-111), so without this exemption one guard
# pressures the session into violating the other. Matched on check NAME.
