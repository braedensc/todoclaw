"""
Stop hook for Todoclaw: nudges Claude before ending a turn on a pushed branch
that either (a) has no PR yet, or (b) has an open PR with failing CI. CLAUDE.md
says "open a PR when the task is done" and "watch CI to green," but those
written rules weren't reliably followed across parallel worktree sessions
(2026-07-03) — this makes both a hard-to-miss reminder instead.

Only fires once per (branch, HEAD commit, reason) — tracked in
.claude/.stop-pr-nag/, gitignored — so it cannot loop even if the harness
doesn't honor stop_hook_active — re-blocking on an unchanged commit/reason
would trap Claude if it explains rather than pushes a new commit. Keying by
reason (not just commit) means opening the PR after a "no PR" nag doesn't
suppress a later "CI failing" nag on that same commit.
